# Zsh 100 Commits Club

ifdef::backend-html5[The document is also available as a link:README.pdf[PDF].]

## Rules
100 commits::
  - the project must have at least 100 commits or be derived from other project, yielding 100 or more total commits,
  - documentation commits are counted but their number is divided by 2 and upper-limited to 10% of all commits.
No forks::
  - the code cannot have many forks (like `$( ... )` constructs) and calls to tools like `grep`, `awk` – such programming style is deprecated, described years ago in the now infamous Advanced Bash Scripting Guide and is not adequate for Zshell. See link:Zsh-Native-Scripting-Handbook.adoc[Zsh Native Scripting Guide] for guidelines to how to code this way.
Points::
  - there are *points* defined:
    * commits (with above limitations) – initial points,
    * non-trivial testing suite – adds 80 points,
    * automatic code documentation with meaningful function comments – adds 50 points,
    * use of `autoload` mechanism for serious functions – adds 50 points,
    * use of `warn_create_global` option – adds 30 points,
    * Travis CI set up to run tests or generate documentation – 50 points.
