# Intro

There are so many plugins on the great
[awesome-zsh-plugins](https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins) page that
it makes sense to filter them out and also to **score** them. The plugins below
contain 50 or more commits and are **evaluated** by an automatic script in order
to detect:
 - ones with 100 or more commits
 - active ones
 - very active ones
 - maintained ones
 - ones having an ongoing research & development

Just take a look at the iconography. It's intuitive and easy to memorize. In
minutes you'll be able to grep interesting plugins with your eyes!

# Iconography

### Devoted time and work detection

ü•à - has 50 or more commits (unused ‚Äì that's the entry to the list boundary)  
ü•á - has 100 or more commits

### Progress detection

üö∂- slow/moderate progress: 1 commit in each of last 3 months or 5 commits in total during the 3 last months (90 days)  
üèÉ- fast progress: 2 commits in each of last 3 months or 10 commits in total during the 3 last months

### Maintenance detection

‚åõÔ∏è- long time no update (updated not in last 3 months, but in last 6 months)  
‚è≥ - updated in last 3 months, active  
‚è∞ - updated in last month and month before it (single new commit will not yield such a strong symbol like the alarm clock; the additional criterion ("month before it") is to take into account only a more constantly attended projects)

### Research & development detection

üíº - has branches with at least 50 commits in total  
üìà ‚Äì the branches were active 3 times in last 4 months
