# Zsh Native Scripting Handbook

This document has been created after 2.5 years of creating software for Zshell
and receiving help from IRC channel #zsh. Avoiding forks was the main guideline
when creating the projects and this lead to multiple discoveries of Zsh constructs
that are fast, robust and do not depend on external tools. Such code is more like
Ruby or Perl code, less like top-down shell scripts.

## Information

### @ is about splitting

How to access all array elements? -- use `@`. However, Zshell completion
(`echo ${(<TAB>`) for `@` says: `@ -- double-quoted splitting of scalars` and
that's the true meaning of this flag / subscript. If you quote e.g. an array,
like `declare -a array; array=( a b c ); print "$array"`, you create a string, a
scalar "a b c". `@` is to go back to non-scalar data by doing *splitting*. Two
forms are available, `"$array[@]"` and `"${(@)array}"`.

## Constructs

### Reading a file

```
declare -a lines; lines=( "${(@f)"$(<path/file)"}" )
```

This preserves empty lines because of double-quoting. `@`-flag is used to obtain
array instead of scalar. If you don't want empty lines preserved, you can also
skip `@`-splitting, as it is explained in Information section:

```
declare -a lines; lines=( ${(f)$(<path/file)} )
```

### Skipping grep

```
declare -a lines; lines=( "${(@f)"$(<path/file)"}" )
declare -a grepped; grepped=( ${(M)lines:#*query*} )
```

To have `grep -v` effect, skip `M`-flag. To grep case insensitively, use `\#i` glob
flag (`...:#(#i)\*query*}`).

### Pattern matching in AND-fashion

```
[[ "abc xyz efg" = *abc*~^*efg* ]] && print Match found
```

The `~` is a negation -- `match \*abc* but not ...`. Then, `^` is also a negation.
The effect is: `\*abc* but not those that don't have \*efg*` which equals to:
`\*abc* but those that have also \*efg*`. This is a regular pattern and it can
be used with `:#` above to search arrays, or with `R`-subscript flag to search
hashes (`${hsh[\(R)\*pattern*]}`), etc. Inventor of those patterns is Mikael
Magnusson.

### Ternary expressions with `\+,-,:+,:-` substitutions

```
HELP="yes"; print ${${HELP:+help enabled}:-help disabled} ▶ help enabled
HELP=""; print ${${HELP:+help enabled}:-help disabled} ▶ help disabled
```

Ternary expression is known from `C` language but exists also in Zsh, but
directly only in math context, i.e. `\(( a = a > 0 ? b : c ))`. Flexibility of
Zsh allows such expressions also in normal context. Above is an example. `:+` is
"if not empty, substitute …" `:-` is "if empty, substitute …". You can save
great number of lines of code with those substitutions, it's normally at least
4-lines `if` condition or lenghty `&&`/`||` use.

### Ternary expressions with `:#` substitution

```
var=abc; print ${${${(M)var:#abc}:+is abc}:-not abc} ▶ is abc
var=abcd; print ${${${(M)var:#abc}:+is abc}:-not abc} ▶ not abc
```

An one-line "if var = x, then …, else …". Again, can spare a great amount of boring
code that makes 10-line function a 20-line one.

### Using built-in regular expressions engine

```
[[ "aabbb" = (#b)(a##)*(b(#c2,2)) ]] && print ${match[1]}-${match[2]} ▶ aa-bb
```

`\##` is: "1 or more". `(#c2,2)` is: "exactly 2". A few other constructs: `#` is
"0 or more", `?` is "any character", `(a|b|)` is "a or b or empty match". `#b`
enables the `$match` parameters. There's also `#m` but it has one parameter
`$MATCH` for whole matched text, not for any parenthesis.

Zsh patterns are basically a custom regular expressions engine. They are
slightly faster than `zsh/regex` module (used for `=~` operator) and don't have
that dependency (regex module can be not present, e.g. in default static build
of Zsh). Also, they can be used in substitutions, for example in `//`
substitution.

### Skipping uniq

```
declare -aU array; array=( a a b ); print $array ▶ a b
declare -a array; array=( a a b ); print ${(u)array} ▶ a b
```

Enable `-U` flag for array so that it guards elements to be unique, or use
`u`-flag to uniquify elements of any array.

### Skipping awk

```
declare -a list; list=( "a,b,c,1,e" "p,q,r,2,t" );
print "${list[@]/(#b)([^,]##,)(#c3,3)([^,]##)*/${match[2]}}" ▶ 1 2
```

The pattern specifies 3 blocks of `[^,]##,` so 3 "not-comma multiple times, then
comma", then single block of "not-comma multiple times" in second parentheses --
and then replaces this with second parentheses. Result is 4th column extracted
from multiple lines of text, something `awk` is often used for. Other method is
use of `s`-flag. For single line of text:

```
text="a,b,c,1,e"; print ${${(s:,:)text}[4]} ▶ 1
```

Thanks to in-substitution code-execution capabilities it's possible to use
`s`-flag to apply it to multiple lines:

```
declare -a list; list=( "a,b,c,1,e" "p,q,r,2,t" );
print "${list[@]/(#m)*/${${(s:,:)MATCH}[4]}}" ▶ 1 2
```

### Searching arrays

```
declare -a array; array=( a b " c1" d ); print ${array[(r)[[:space:]][[:alpha:]]*]} ▶  c1
```

`\[[:space:]]` contains unicode spaces. This is often used in conditional
expression like `[[ -z ${array[(r)...]} ]]`.

### Code execution in `//` substitution

```
append() { gathered+=( $array[$1] ); }
functions -M append 1 1 append
declare -a array; array=( "Value 1" "Other data" "Value 2" )
declare -a gathered; integer idx=0
: ${array[@]/(#b)(Value ([[:digit:]]##)|*)/$(( ${#match[2]} > 0 ? append(++idx) : ++idx ))}
print $gathered ▶ Value 1 Value 2
```

Use of `#b` glob flag enables math-code execution (and not only) in `/` and `//`
substitutions. Implementation is very fast.

### Serializing data

```
declare -A hsh deserialized; hsh=( key value )
serialized="${(j: :)${(qkv@)hsh}}"
deserialized=( "${(Q@)${(z@)serialized}}" )
print ${(kv)deserialized} ▶ key value
```

`j`-flag means join -- by spaces, in this case. Flags `kv` mean: keys and values,
interleaving. Important `q`-flag means: quote. So what is obtained is each key
and value quoted, and put into string separated by spaces.

`z`-flag means: split as if Zsh parser would split. So quoting (with backslashes,
double quoting and other) is recognized. Obtained is array `( "key" "value")`
which is then dequoted with `Q`-flag. This yields original data, assigned to
hash `deserialized`. Use this to e.g. implement array of hashes.
