# Zsh Plugin Standard

## Standarized $0 handling

Plugins should do:

```zsh
0="${${ZERO:-${(M)0##/*}}:-${(%):-%N}}"
# or
ZERO="${${ZERO:-${(M)0##/*}}:-${(%):-%N}}"

# Then ${0:h} or ${ZERO:h} to get plugin's directory
```

to get plugin path. The one-line code above will:

1. Use `ZERO` if it's not empty
  * plugin manager will be easily able to alter effective `$0` before loading a plugin
  * this will allow to e.g. do `eval "$(<plugin)"`, which is faster than `source` (link:http://www.zsh.org/mla/workers/2017/msg01827.html[comparison])
2. Use `$0` if it contains absolute path
  * plugin manager will still be able to set `$0`, although more difficultly
  * `setopt no_function_argzero` will be detected (it causes `$0` not to contain absolute path, but path to Zsh binary)
3. Use `%N` prompt expansion flag, which always gives absolute path to script
  * plugin manager cannot alter this

The goal is flexibility and robustness, with essential motivation to support `eval "$(<plugin)"` and definitely
solving `setopt no_function_argzero` case.
