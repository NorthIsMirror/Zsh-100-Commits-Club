## What Is A Zsh Plugin?

Historically, Zsh plugins were first defined by Oh My Zsh. They provide for a
way to package together files that extend or configure the shell’s functionality
in a particular way.

At a simple level, a plugin:

1. Has its directory added to `$fpath`
(link:http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Functions.html#Autoloading-Functions[Zsh
documentation]).
2. Has its first `\*.plugin.zsh` file sourced (or `*.zsh`, `init.zsh`, `*.sh`,
   these are non-standard).

The first point allows plugins to provide completions and functions that are
loaded via Zsh’s `autoload` mechanism (a single function per-file).

From a more broad perspective, a plugin consists of:

1. A directory containing various files (main script, autoload functions,
   completions, Makefiles, backend programs, documentation).

2. A sourcable script that obtains the path to its directory via `$0` (see the
   link:#zero-handling[next section] for a related enhancement proposal).

3. A Github (or other site) repository identified by two components
   **username**/**pluginname**.

4. A software package containing any type of command line artifacts – when used
   with advanced plugin managers that have hooks, can run Makefiles, add
   directories to `$PATH`.

Below follow proposed enhancements and codifications of the definition of a "Zsh
plugin" and the actions of plugin managers – the proposed standardization. +
 +

'''

[#zero-handling]
## 1. Standardized `$0` Handling

To get the plugin’s location, plugins should do:

```zsh
0="${${ZERO:-${0:#$ZSH_ARGZERO}}:-${(%):-%N}}"
0="${${(M)0:#/*}:-$PWD/$0}"

# Then ${0:h} to get plugin’s directory
```

The one-line code above will:

1. Be backwards-compatible with normal `$0` setting and usage.

2. Use `ZERO` if it’s not empty,

      - the plugin manager will be easily able to alter effective `$0` before
        loading a plugin,

      - this allows for e.g. `eval "$(<plugin)"`, which can be faster
        than `source`
        (link:http://www.zsh.org/mla/workers/2017/msg01827.html[comparison]
        note that it’s not for a compiled script).

3. Use `$0` if it doesn’t contain the path to the Zsh binary,

      - plugin manager will still be able to set `$0`, although more difficultly
        (requires `unsetopt function_argzero` before sourcing plugin script, and
        `0=…​` assignment),

      - `unsetopt function_argzero` will be detected (it causes `$0` not to
        contain plugin-script path, but path to Zsh binary, if not overwritten
        by a `0=…​` assignment),
    
      - `setopt posix_argzero` will be detected (as above).

4. Use `%N` prompt expansion flag, which always gives absolute path to script,

      - plugin manager cannot alter this (no advanced loading of plugin
        is possible), but simple plugin-file sourcing (without a plugin
        manager) will be saved from breaking caused by the mentioned
        `*_argzero` options, so this is a very good last-resort
        fallback.

5. Finally, in the second line, it will ensure that `$0` contains an absolute
   path by prepending it with `$PWD` if necessary.

The goal is flexibility, with essential motivation to support `eval
"$(<plugin)"` and definitely solve `setopt no_function_argzero` and `setopt
posix_argzero` cases.

A plugin manager will be even able to convert a plugin to a function (author
implemented such proof of concept functionality, it’s fully possible – also in
an automatic fashion), but performance differences of this are yet unclear. It
might however provide a use case.

The last, 5th point also allows to use the `$0` handling in scripts (i.e.
runnables with the hashbang `#!…`) to get the directory in which the script
file resides.

[#unload-fun]
## 2. Unload Function

If a plugin is named e.g. `kalc` (and is available via `an-user/kalc`
plugin-ID), then it can provide a function, `kalc_plugin_unload`, that can be
called by a plugin manager to undo the effects of loading that plugin.

A plugin manager can implement its own tracking of changes made by a plugin so
this is in general optional. However, to properly unload e.g. a prompt, detailed
tracking (easy to do by the plugin creator) can provide better, predictable
results. Any special, uncommon effects of loading a plugin are possible to undo
only by a dedicated function.

However, an interesting compromise approach is available – to withdraw only the
special effects of loading a plugin via the dedicated, plugin-provided function
and leave the rest to the plugin manager. The value of such approach is that
maintaining of such function (if it is to withdraw **all** plugin side-effects)
can be a daunting task requiring constant monitoring of it during the plugin
develoment process.

[#indicator]
## 3. Plugin Manager Activity Indicator

Plugin managers should set the `$zsh_loaded_plugins` array to contain all
previously loaded plugins and the plugin currently being loaded (as the last
element). This will allow plugins to:

 1. Check which plugins are already loaded.
 2. Check if it is being loaded by a plugin manager (i.e. not just sourced).

The first item allows a plugin to e.g. issue a notice about missing
dependencies. Instead of issuing a notice, it may be able to satisfy the
dependencies from resources it provides. For example, `pure` prompt provides
`zsh-async` dependency library, which is a separate project and can be loaded by
the user directly. Consequently, the prompt can decide to source its private
copy of `zsh-async`, having also reliable `$0` defined by previous section
(note: `pure` doesn’t normally do this).

The second item allows a plugin to e.g. set up `$fpath`, knowing that plugin
manager will not handle this:

```zsh
if [[ (${+zsh_loaded_plugins} = 0 || ${zsh_loaded_plugins[-1]} != */kalc) \
    && -z ${fpath[(r)${0:h}]} ]]
then
    fpath+=( "${0:h}" )
fi
```

This will allow user to reliably source the plugin without using a plugin
manager.

[#zpfx]
## 4. Global Parameter With PREFIX For Make, Configure, Etc.

Plugin managers may export the parameter `$ZPFX` which should contain a path to
a directory dedicated for user-land software, i.e. for directories `$ZPFX/bin`,
`$ZPFX/lib`, `$ZPFX/share`, etc. Suggested name of the directory is `polaris`,
Zplugin uses this name and places this directory at `~/.zplugin/polaris` by
default.

User can then configure hooks (feature of e.g. zplug and Zplugin) to invoke e.g.
`make PREFIX=$ZPFX install` to install software like e.g.
link:https://github.com/tj/git-extras[tj/git-extras]. This is a developing role
of Zsh plugin managers as package managers, where `.zshrc` has a similar role to
Chef or Puppet configuration and allows to **declare** system state, and have
the same state on different accounts / machines.

No-narration facts-list related to `$ZPFX`:

 1. `export ZPFX="$HOME/polaris"` (or e.g. `$HOME/.zplugin/polaris`)
 2. `make PREFIX=$ZPFX install`
 3. `./configure --prefix=$ZPFX`
 4. `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$ZPFX .`
 5. `zplugin ice make"PREFIX=$ZPFX install"`
 6. `zplug … hook-build:"make PREFIX=$PFX install"`

[#best-practices]
## Zsh Plugin-Programming Best Practices

The document is to define a *Zsh-plugin* but also to serve as an information
source for plugin creators. Therefore, it covers also a best practices
information in this section.

[#azh]
### Use Of `add-zsh-hook` To Install Hooks

Zsh ships with a function `add-zsh-hook`. It has the following invocation
syntax:

```zsh
add-zsh-hook [ -L | -dD ] [ -Uzk ] hook function
```

The function installs a `function` as one of the supported zsh `hook` entries.
which are one of: `chpwd`, `periodic`, `precmd`, `preexec`, `zshaddhistory`,
`zshexit`, `zsh_directory_name`. For their meaning refer to the
link:http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Functions.html#Hook-Functions[Zsh
documentation].

[#azhw]
### Use Of `add-zle-hook-widget` To Install Zle Hooks

Zle editor is the part of the Zsh that is responsible for receiving the text
from the user. It can be said that it’s based on widgets, which are nothing more
than Zsh functions that are allowed to be ran in Zle context, i.e. from the Zle
editor (plus a few minor differences, like the `$WIDGET` parameter that’s
automatically set by the Zle editor).

The syntax of the call is:

```zsh
add-zle-hook-widget [ -L | -dD ] [ -Uzk ] hook widgetname
```

The call resembles the syntax of the `add-zsh-hook` function. The only
difference is that it takes a `widgetname`, not a function name, and that the
`hook` is being one of: `isearch-exit`, `isearch-update`, `line-pre-redraw`,
`line-init`, `line-finish`, `history-line-set`, or `keymap-select`. Their
meaning is explained in the
link:http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html#Special-Widgets[Zsh
documentation].

The use of this function is recommended because it allows to
install **multiple** hooks per each `hook` entry. Before introducing the
`add-zle-hook-widget` function the "normal" way to install a hook was to define
widget with the name of one of the special widgets. Now, after the function has
been introduced in Zsh `5.3` it should be used instead.
