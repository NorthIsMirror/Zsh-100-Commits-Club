## What is a Zsh plugin?

Zsh plugins were first defined by Oh-My-Zsh. They provide for a way to package
together files that extend or configure the shell's functionality in a
particular way.

At a simple level, a plugin:

1. Has its directory added to `$fpath`
(link:http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Functions.html#Autoloading-Functions[zsh
doc]).
2. Has its first `\*.plugin.zsh` file sourced (or `*.zsh`, `init.zsh`, `*.sh`,
   these are non-standard).

The first point allows plugins to provide completions and functions that are
loaded via Zsh's  `autoload` mechanism (a single function per-file).

From a more broad perspective, a plugin consists of:

1. A directory containing various files (main script, autoload functions,
   completions, Makefiles, backend programs, documentation).
2. A script that obtains the path to its directory via `$0` (see the
   link:#zero-handling[next section] for a related enhancement proposal).
3. A Github (or other site) repository identified by two components
   **username**/**pluginname**.
4. A software package containing any type of command line artifacts – when used
   with advanced plugin managers that have hooks, can run Makefiles, add
   directories to `$PATH`.

Below follow proposed enhancements and codifications of the definition of a "Zsh
plugin" and the actions of plugin managers – the proposed standardization. +
 +

'''

[#zero-handling]
## 1. Standardized $0 handling

To get the plugin's location, plugins should do:

```zsh
0="${${ZERO:-${0:#$ZSH_ARGZERO}}:-${(%):-%N}}"
0="${${(M)0#/*}:-$PWD/$0}"

# Then ${0:h} to get plugin's directory
```

The one-line code above will:

1. Be backwards-compatible with normal `$0` setting and usage.
2. Use `ZERO` if it's not empty,
  * plugin manager will be easily able to alter effective `$0` before loading a plugin,
  * this allows for e.g. `eval "$(<plugin)"`, which can be faster than `source`
    (link:http://www.zsh.org/mla/workers/2017/msg01827.html[comparison], note
    that it's not for a compiled script).
3. Use `$0` if it doesn't contain the path to the Zsh binary,
  * plugin manager will still be able to set `$0`, although more difficultly
    (requires `unsetopt function_argzero` before sourcing plugin script, and
    `0=...` assignment),
  * `unsetopt function_argzero` will be detected (it causes `$0` not to contain
    plugin-script path, but path to Zsh binary, if not overwritten by `0=...`
    assignment),
  * `setopt posix_argzero` will be detected (as above).
4. Use `%N` prompt expansion flag, which always gives absolute path to script,
  * plugin manager cannot alter this (no advanced loading of plugin is
    possible), but simple plugin-file sourcing (without a plugin manager) will
    be saved from breaking caused by the mentioned `*_argzero` options, so this
    is a very good last-resort fallback.
5. Finally, in the second line, it will ensure that `$0` contains an absolute
   path by prepending it with `$PWD` if necessary.

The goal is flexibility, with essential motivation to support `eval
"$(<plugin)"` and definitely solve `setopt no_function_argzero` and `setopt
posix_argzero` cases.

A plugin manager will be even able to convert a plugin to a function (author
implemented such proof of concept functionality, it's possible), but performance
differences of this are yet unclear. It might however provide a use case.

The last, 5th point also allows to use the `$0` handling in scripts (i.e.
runnables with the hashbang `#!...`) to get the directory in which the script
file resides.

[#unload-fun]
## 2. Unload function

If a plugin is named e.g. `kalc` (and is available via `an-user/kalc`
plugin-ID), then it can provide a function, `kalc_unload_plugin`, that can be
called by a plugin manager to undo the effects of loading that plugin.

A plugin manager can implement its own tracking of changes made by a plugin so
this is in general optional. However, to properly unload e.g. a prompt, detailed
tracking (easy to do by the plugin creator) can provide better, predictable
results. Any special, uncommon effects of loading a plugin are possible to undo
only by a dedicated function.

[#indicator]
## 3. Plugin manager activity indicator

Plugin managers should set the `$zsh_loaded_plugins` array to contain all
previously loaded plugins and the plugin currently being loaded (as the last
element). This will allow plugins to:

 1. Check which plugins are already loaded.
 2. Check if it is being loaded by a plugin manager (i.e. not just sourced).

The first item allows a plugin to e.g. issue a notice about missing dependencies.
Instead of issuing a notice, it may be able to satisfy the dependencies from
resources it provides. For example, `pure` prompt provides `zsh-async`
dependency library, which is a separate project and can be loaded by the user
directly. Consequently, the prompt can decide to source its private copy of
`zsh-async`, having also reliable `$0` defined by previous section (note: `pure`
doesn't normally do this).

The second item allows a plugin to e.g. set up `$fpath`, knowing that plugin
manager will not handle this:

```zsh
if [[ ( ${+zsh_loaded_plugins} = 0 || ${zsh_loaded_plugins[-1]} != */kalc ) && -z "${fpath[(r)${0:h}]}" ]]
then
    fpath+=( "${0:h}" )
fi
```

This will allow user to reliably source the plugin without using a plugin manager.

[#zpfx]
## 4. Global parameter with PREFIX for make, configure, etc.

Plugin managers may export the parameter `$ZPFX` which should contain a path to
a directory dedicated for user-land software, i.e. for directories `$ZPFX/bin`,
`$ZPFX/lib`, `$ZPFX/share`, etc.  Suggested name of the directory is `polaris`,
Zplugin uses this name and places this directory at `~/.zplugin/polaris` by
default.

User can then configure hooks (feature of e.g. zplug and Zplugin) to invoke e.g.
`make PREFIX=$ZPFX install` to install software like e.g.
link:https://github.com/tj/git-extras[tj/git-extras]. This is a developing role
of Zsh plugin managers as package managers, where `.zshrc` has a similar role to
Chef or Puppet configuration and allows to **declare** system state, and have
the same state on different accounts / machines.

No-narration facts-list related to `$ZPFX`:

 1. `export ZPFX="$HOME/polaris"` (or e.g. `$HOME/.zplugin/polaris`)
 2. `make PREFIX=$ZPFX install`
 3. `./configure --prefix=$ZPFX`
 4. `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$ZPFX .`
 5. `zplugin ice make"PREFIX=$ZPFX install"`
 6. `zplug ... hook-build:"make PREFIX=$PFX install"`
